# Project Portfolio

With this portfolio, I want to demonstrate my skills in solving business problems using data science concepts and tools through projects using public data. You will also find my professional experiences, skills, tools, and concepts involving Data Science.

## About me

My name is Jéssica, and I am a passionate data scientist. My academic background includes degrees in Science and Technology and Chemical Engineering as well as a postgraduate qualification in Project Management. Over the past five years, I have dedicated my career to the tax consultancy field, assisting companies in securing tax benefits related to Research and Development in Technological Innovation. 

During my professional journey, I developed a deep passion for the data universe, which has inspired me to embark on a continuous learning path in data science since 2023. Over the past year, I have been dedicating myself to mastering all stages of business solutions development leveraging concepts, tools, and technologies of Data Science — from business understanding to model deployment. 

By combining my technical background in Chemical Engineering, my experience in management and consultancy, and my enthusiasm for data and technology, I am committed to finding creative and innovative solutions to market challenges. I am open to new opportunities that foster learning, collaboration, and meaningful impact in solving business problems.
